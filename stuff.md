### What do these numbers have in common?
  14 dimensions, prime


### Entropy,

$`H(X) = Epln(1/P(X)) = -[P(X = 0)lnP(X=0)+P(X=1)lnP(X=1)]`$

$`H(X) = -(qlnq+plnp), q = P(X=0), p = P(X = 1)`$

The entropy is maximized when p = 0.5, indicating the highest level of uncertainty when both outcomes are equally likely. The entropy is zero when or p=0, or p = 1., where one outcome is certain.

In the 19th century, physicists developed the methods of statistical mechanics for studying many-particle systems, whereas mathematicians proved the distribution law for prime numbers. It turns out that the two apparently different approaches can be traced back to the same mathematical root, namely, the notion of partition function. In modern quantum field theory, the Feynman functional integral can be viewed as a partition function, as we will discuss later on. The typical procedure proceeds in the following two steps.

N2  - This is the first volume of a modern introduction to quantum field theory which addresses both mathematicians and physicists ranging from advanced undergraduate students to professional scientists. The book tries to bridge the existing gap between the different languages used by mathematicians and physicists. For students of mathematics it is shown that detailed knowledge of the physical background helps to motivate the mathematical subjects and to discover interesting interrelationships between quite different mathematical topics. For students of physics, fairly advanced mathematics is presented, which is beyond the usual curriculum in physics. It is the author's goal to present the state of the art of realizing Einstein's dream of a unified theory for the four fundamental forces in the universe (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak interaction). From the reviews: ". Quantum field theory is one of the great intellectual edifices in the history of human thought. This volume differs from other books on quantum field theory in its greater emphasis on the interaction of physics with mathematics. an impressive work of scholarship." (William G. Faris, SIAM Review, Vol. 50 (2), 2008) ". it is a fun book for practicing quantum field theorists to browse, and it may be similarly enjoyed by mathematical colleagues. Its ultimate value may lie in encouraging students to enter this challenging interdisciplinary area of mathematics and physics. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through faculty.".

It's my lucky day. I solved for prime numbers. I was messing around with equations and papers and homework and math. Got into prime numbers based off ideas of 10 digit numbers and divisibility, and into Bernoulli’s distribution. I went through [partitions](
https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=4wpjDroAAAAJ&citation_for_view=4wpjDroAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), into [Bernoullis distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution), and [numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_number), from [Fermat’s little theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proofs_of_Fermat's_little_theorem), and unto of course my flavor into the interpretations and sudo math., inlcuding...

q = 1 - p
since 
p − 1 ≡ −1 (mod p)
q = -1

-1 not ttrivial zero
equality between a sum and a product

1 sum = product
q = -1
q = -1 * n : inf
1 - p = -1 * n
(1-p)/n = -1
-1/n - p/n = -1

1/n + p/n = 1

p - 1 = -1 mod p
p = 0

1/n + 0/n = 1
n =/= 0

1/n + 0/n - 1 = 0
1((x/n) + 0/n - (x)) = 0

1c ((xn^[1/2]) + 0/n - (x)) = 0
n = {Integral{log(e)}}

the Riemann hypothesis is the conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part ⁠1/2

x = sqrt(x^2 + 1)
x = {0, |x| - 1}
x = {0, (|log(e)| - 1) * } = {0, .5657055181}
{.567055181, .5052250171}
{b,c} graph
b is divisible by 7, c is divisible by 11 and is my phone number
11 and 7 are prime numbers

11 and 7 at integer magnitude = b and c
b / 7 = 81,007,883
refract at magnitude change: .81007883
c / 11 = 205,004,561 : 2.05004561

remember |log(e)| - 1 = .5675055181
.56570055 = 56570055 is divisible by 3
.5675955181 = 5675955181 is divisible by 13
.567055181 = 567055181 is divisible by 7
x = log(e)
e * pi = 8.5397
.81007883 + .5675055181 = 
8.5397 - .5675055181 = 7.972287 , 8.1007883 == 8.0365

This constant 8.0365 will be valuable later on. It is a base off our n=/=0 earlier. Providing at least one value is all we need in order to understand what the root of the partition, n, is. This will explain the patterns, physical applications, and unique prime characteristics that follow the 19th century in which physicists developed the methods of statistical mechanics for studying many-particle systems, whereas mathematicians proved the distribution law for prime numbers. It turns out that the two apparently different approaches can be traced back to the same mathematical root, namely, the notion of partition function. In modern quantum field theory, the Feynman functional integral can be viewed as a partition function, as we will discuss later on.

integral(sqrt(x^2 + 1)dx) = (ln|x+(sqrt(x^2 + 1))| + x(sqrt(x^2 + 1)))/2 + c
= sqrt(x^2 + 1)

x = sqrt(x^2 + 1)
x =11, 7, … any other prime numbers?
Is what is below similar to what is above?
It needs to be proved.

11 >> 11.04536101718726 == 1104536101718726 , is divisible by 2 a *prime number*

7 >> 7.071067811865475 == 7071067811865475 is divisible by 5 a *prime number*



Occams razor, probablistic determinatiom here.
### What is divisible by the prime numbers?

567055181 is divisible by 7,  a *prime number*
81007883 is divisible by 11, a *prime number*
7972287, 56570055, 56750551851, 5,675,055,243 is divisible by 3, *a prime number*
5675955181 is divisible by 13, a *prime number*
1442695040888963 is divisible by 17, a *prime number*
7071067811865475 is divisible by 5, a *prime number*

56750551851 is *prime*
29 is *prime*

7,364,353 is divisible by 1753, a *prime number*

```
what are three solutions to these:
let’s coordinate based on the low prime numbers:
and remember, based on the equations above, there still remains more prime numbers to solve
for by arithmetic
a1 :: 7 = 
!
b1 :: 11
c1 :: 3
d1 :: 13
it isnt in order, and our scale is constantly growing. continue on with this subseries, a box if u will. apply phyiscal laws and let’s also dicsuss the perturbation of electromagnetic field via flame ore fire:

and rounding out some stuff; as well as sin - cos 
61.5 sin elog10- cos = = -0.992420195199509

0.047425172189568

We want to get to close to 0. Because n =/= 0.

1c ((xn^[1/2]) + 0/n - (x)) = 0
n = {Integral{log(e)}}

Now I am going to increment i numbers by 1/2, add them, for pooling prime numbers
7.5i
11.5i
13.5i
5675055181i and 5675055181.5i and 56750551851i
1753.5i
17.5i



7.5 + 11.5 is 19, a *prime number*
17.5 + 11.5 is 29, a *prime number*

now apply x = sqrt(x^2 + 1)

5,675,055,243 = +

1.442695040888963 = log2(e)

5675055181 is prime, a number i wrote wrongly (567055181...)

ln(e) - 1 = -7.6505219853240925714770858378589e-48

Addition and count of the prime numbers is important here. Then we get into means, Likelihood function, Laurent series all in order to understand the pattern and parameters we are working with. Let’s initiate a function, as I have been doing. constant q = 8.

- Likelihood function: how well a statistical model explains observed data by calculating the probability of seeing that data under different parameter values of the model

GiL, i imaginary number, Gravity constant G, and length measurement (for quantum probabilities)

The likelihood function, parameterized by a (possibly multivariate) parameter theta, is usually defined differently for discrete and continuous probability distributions (a more general definition is discussed below). Given a probability density or mass function
x -> f(x | theta)
where x is a realization of the random variable X, the likelihood function is theta -> f(x | theta)
often written L(theta | x)

### Feynman functional integral 

My conclusions, 
Gravity constant * iL(theta | x)

1.442695040888963 = log2(e)

1415283835112073 is divisible by 3.




Assume that X
 is a finite-dimensional Banach space. I know that, in general, if two functions f,g:X→R
 are convex, then the function (f−g):X→R
 given by x↦f(x)−g(x)
 is not necessarily convex. Are there conditions we can impose on f
 and g
 so that the difference is still convex, e.g., if f(x)≥g(x)


 Fermat's little thorem steas that if p is a prime number, then for any integer a, the number a^p - a is an integer multiple of p.
 Carmichael number is a composite number n in which in modular arithmetic staisfies the congruence relation: b^n = b (mod n) for all integers b.
 A Giuga number is a composite number n such that for each of its distinct prie factors p initial we have p initial | ( (n/p initial) - 1 ) or equvalently such that for each of its distinct prime factors p  intial we have p initaial ^2 | (n - p initial)
