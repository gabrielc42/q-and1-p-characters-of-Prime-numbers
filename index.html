How Fish see the world...
I started playing with numbers and got deeply fascinated with what I was finding. 
Have yet to read through thoroughly enough of the many sources, but they are not haphazardly inputted into this. 
And of course, some of this may seem contrived and incorrect. 
However, our lives are too short to restrict ourselves the abundance of the universe and dwaddle with trivial mistakes, especially when it comes to enjoying math. 
I hope to continue research with these topics, of all the key words listed below. Love math and physics!

<h1># Characteristics of numbers 11, 7, 3, 5675055181, 13, 1753, 56750551851, 17, 29, 19, 2, 5, 4273, 127, 23 and other transcendental numbers
  under Bernoulli distribution of influence of sets and Likelihood function, 
  to discuss physical laws of prime numbers, imaginary partition functions, and the Riemann hypothesis. 
  Continued reflection on proof by Laurent series and Likelihood function. 
  Latter conjecture about Electroweak fields, fluid dynamics, and holomorphism.
</h1>

<h4>In this discussion I present a series of equatins, arithmetic, and various utilities in order to studying a multitude of systems. </h4>
I begin with pertitent information regarding origin points, but in reality I began with just numbers.
Continuous reasoning and findings of prime numbers alongside partition review led me to discover for a another time the significance of prime numbers and partitions, including the zeta function. 

<h4>I brought about several research topics that deal with physical laws and applications between these numbers and characteristics, as well as methodologies simply derived and interpreted by myself 
and hopefully following some rational sound math formula and strategies in order to rediscover through a similar path an array of transcendental numbers,
including a lost one, dealing with other various intricacies and multiplots of prime numbers, special formulas and conjectures, all in order to study systems that exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, 
such as some particles. Imaginary thermodynamics anyone?</h4>

the proof of the important Orlicz- Pettis theorem which claims the equivalence of weak and strong unconditional convergence of series in Banach spaces. 
The second paragraph contains Riemann’s theorem which asserts that absolute and unconditional convergence of series in finite dimensional vector spaces are the same, 
and the famous Dvoretzky-Rogers theorem. The latter states the existence in every infinite dimensional Banach space of an unconditional series which is not absolutely convergent,
a fact, which has been conjectured for about twenty years and which has been settled down by Dvoretzky and Rogers in 1950.

In the 19th century, physicists developed the methods of statistical mechanics for studying many-particle systems, whereas mathematicians proved the distribution law for prime numbers. It turns out that the two apparently different approaches can be traced back to the same mathematical root, namely, the notion of partition function. In modern quantum field theory, the Feynman functional integral can be viewed as a partition function, as we will discuss later on. The typical procedure proceeds in the following two steps.
```
The imaginary partition function is useful in studying systems that exhibit quantum mechanical behavior, such as atoms and molecules

N2  - This is the first volume of a modern introduction to quantum field theory which addresses both mathematicians and physicists ranging from advanced undergraduate students to professional scientists. The book tries to bridge the existing gap between the different languages used by mathematicians and physicists. For students of mathematics it is shown that detailed knowledge of the physical background helps to motivate the mathematical subjects and to discover interesting interrelationships between quite different mathematical topics. For students of physics, fairly advanced mathematics is presented, which is beyond the usual curriculum in physics. It is the author's goal to present the state of the art of realizing Einstein's dream of a unified theory for the four fundamental forces in the universe (gravitational, electromagnetic, strong, and weak interaction). From the reviews: ". Quantum field theory is one of the great intellectual edifices in the history of human thought. This volume differs from other books on quantum field theory in its greater emphasis on the interaction of physics with mathematics. an impressive work of scholarship." (William G. Faris, SIAM Review, Vol. 50 (2), 2008) ". it is a fun book for practicing quantum field theorists to browse, and it may be similarly enjoyed by mathematical colleagues. Its ultimate value may lie in encouraging students to enter this challenging interdisciplinary area of mathematics and physics. Summing Up: Recommended. Upper-division undergraduates through faculty.".

<h4>3. Therefore e^(iPi/2) = i.</h4>
<h4>4. Take the ith power of both sides, the right side being i^i and the left side = [e^(iPi/2)]^i = e^(-Pi/2).</h4>

  Neat...however incorrect.
  Not sure why my calculator gave wrong answers.
   But still,
   <h4>2^(1/log(2)) = e</h4>
   <h4>16^(1/log(2)) = e^4</h4>

<h2>continued fraction theorem</h2>
  Let x be an irrational number where 0<x<1 and
d_n (x) = 10^(-n) floor(10^n x)
e_n (x) = 10^(-n) (floor(10^n x) + 1)
be decimal approximations of x, m be a Lebesgue measure set, x = continued fraction k _(n=1)^∞ 1/a_n
be the regular continued fraction of x, d_n(x) = continued fraction k _(n=1)^∞ 1/(b_1(n))
be the regular continued fraction of d_n(x), e_n(x) = continued fraction k _(n=1)^∞ 1/(b_2(n))
be the regular continued fraction of e_n(x), and
k_n(x) = sup({i: for all i<=n, b_1(i) = b_2(i)}).
Then
for almost all x, lim_(n->∞) k_n/n = (6ln 2 ln 10)/π^2.

Assume that X
 is a finite-dimensional Banach space. I know that, in general, if two functions f,g:X→R
 are convex, then the function (f−g):X→R
 given by x↦f(x)−g(x)
 is not necessarily convex. Are there conditions we can impose on f
 and g
 so that the difference is still convex, e.g., if f(x)≥g(x)
